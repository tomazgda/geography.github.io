   /Mull Lava Group - Basalt. Igneous Bedrock formed approximately 56 to 66 million years ago in the Palaeogene Period. Local environment previously dominated by eruptions of silica-poor magma./

   /eruptions of silica-poor magma. These igneous rocks are volcanic (extrusive) in origin. Poor in silica, they form fluid flows of lava with feeder dykes and sills./

** Caves 

(Dictionary) /A natural underground chamber in a hillside or cliff/ . Essentially, a cave is the first landform created when coastal erosion acts on a cliff.   
   
Lines of weakness in a headland are especially vulnerable to erosion. Coastal erosion, predominately hydraulic action and abrasion, act on these lines of weakness until a cave is formed.

** Arches

If a cave is situated on one side of a headland, it could be eroded through to form an arch. 
   
** Stacks

** Stumps

* Formation of Wave Cut Platforms
